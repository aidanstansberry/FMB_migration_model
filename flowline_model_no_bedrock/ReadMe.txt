!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! NOTE: This model does not contain thermally active bedrock and is therefore limited            !!!
!!! The intent of this model is for comparison with the full model in the directory flowline_model !!!

!!! 1) How to use this model     !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	a) Get ElmerFEM software https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer/binaries
	b) convert the mesh to a format usable by elmer
		$ gmsh -2 1k_mesh.geo 
		$ ElmerGrid 14 2 1k_mesh.msh
	c) run each step (1,2,3,4) to completion in order. .vtu output can be easily viewed in paraview, and from there data can be saved in a .csv format.
		$ ElmerSolver step.sif

!!! 2) File Descriptions         !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	a) 1k_mesh.geo/1k_mesh.msh
		Used to create the 2-D mesh for the flowline. A 2 layer rectangle with a top layer (ice) thickness of 20 m and a bottom layer (bedrock) thickness of 3000 m and a length of 480 km is defined. 


	b) avgdts.dat
		Average yearly temperature anomaly data for the flowline.

		first column: time (years) | additional column(s): delta temperature (degC)


	c) Bed.dat
		The topography at the bed of the ice sheet. This data is from data for the flowline. synthetic beds used can be created using ../useful_scripts/bedmaker.py

		first column: distance (m) | additional column(s): elevation (m)


	d) DummySolver/DummySolver.F90
		A user function necessary for the creation and storage of several variables used in the model.


	e) ModernPrecip.dat
		The modern surface precipitation data along the flowline.

		first column: distance (m) | additional column(s): monthly precip (m w.e. (meters water equivalent))


	f) ModernSuface.dat
		The modern surface elevation data along the flowline.

		first column: distance (m) | additional column(s): elevation (m)


	g) ModernTemp.dat 
		Modern monthly suface temperature data along the flowline.

		first column: distance (m) | additional column(s): temperature (degC)


	h) ModernTempAvg
		Yearly average modern surface temperature data along the flowline.

		first column: distance (m) | additional column(s): temperature (degC)


	i) monthlydps.dat
		monthly precipitation anomaly data for the flowline
		
		first column: time (years) | additional column(s): monthly precip (m w.e. (meters water equivalent))

	
	j) montlydts.dat
		monthly temperature anomaly data for the flowine

		first column: time (years) | additional column(s): delta temperature (degC)

	
	k) north_initial_suface.dat
		ice sheet suface elvation to initialize the model

		first column: distance (m) | additional column(s): elevation (m)


	l) smb_model_jake_data/smb_model_jake_data.F90
		user functions needed to calculate the surface mass balace for the flowline. Adapted from a surface mass balance model written in python by jake downs hence the name


	m) step1_initial_steady_state.sif
		With initial ice sheet geometry configuation run a steady state temperature iteration

	
	n) step2_run_to_steady_profile_dp_46.sif
		Allows ice sheet suface to evolve until desired initial terminus position is achieved (~3.5 kyrs)


	o) step3_initial_steady_state_temp.sif
		Get the initial internal temperature of the ice sheet and bedrock to steady state


	p) step4_run_climate_scenario.sif
		Runs the transient flowline evolution simulation from 11.4 kyr to present driven by temperature and precipitation anomalies.
